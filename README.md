## Abstract:

Open source tools for brain signal analysis have greatly matured in recent years. A guided tour will be proposed on the design of EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) using open-source tools. 

We will explore real-world applications of BCI, the main paradigms used in the field, and the different types of variabilities to overcome. With HappyFeat, you will gain practical knowledge in extracting and selecting features from EEG signals. Additionally, you will learn how to assess machine-learning pipelines using MOABB, a powerful tool that prioritizes reproducibility and replicability. 

Then, you will acquire practical experience through hands-on activities and tutorials. We will introduce Timeflux, a Python framework tailored for the development of real-time BCI applications. After delving into the challenges faced by end-users, we will unveil a novel BCI paradigm designed to streamline calibration time, prioritize visual comfort, and deliver high accuracy using dry EEG technology.


## Intended audience
Anyone interested in practical BCIs: neuroscientists, research engineers, developers. Programming or data science skills are great but not required for this workshop.
